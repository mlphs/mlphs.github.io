In supervised learning, we have datasets where each example was labeled as either a positive or negative example (e.g. donut or bagel). For each example, we were told explicitly what the “right answer” is.

In unsupervised learning, we are given data that does not have any labels. We’re given a dataset, and our goal is to find some type of structure in the data.

Given the dataset, an unsupervised learning algorithm might decide that the data lives in two different clusters. This is called a clustering algorithm.

Clustering can be used for many applications, such as 
<ul> 
<li> Organizing large computer clusters to make data centers work more efficiently </li>
<li> Identify cohesive groups of friends in social network analysis </li>
<li> Group customers into different market segments to automatically and more efficiently sell or market to your
     different market segments together </li>
<li> Perform astronomical data analysis to get interesting and useful theories about how galaxies are formed </li>
</ul>
