Movies and book have depicted a generalized AI, one that can answer any question we might have, and do anything a human can do. Unfortunately, this is not realistic. 

A machine is said to have **artificial intelligence** if it can interpret data, potentially learn from the data, and use that knowledge to adapt and achieve specific goals.

Some more obvious uses of AI include Alexa, Roomba, Siri, and more. But, there are a ton of less obvious examples! When we buy something in a big store or online, AI decides which and how many items to stock. When we scroll through Facebook or Instagram,  AI decides which ads we see. 

AI even affects big life decisions. For example, when you submit your college or application, AI might be screening it before a human even sees it.

AI and automation is changing everything, from commerce to jobs. This change is global, some people are excited about it, and others are afraid of it. Either way, we all have the responsibility to understand AI and figure out what role AI will play in our lives.
